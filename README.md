# Merging Reversed Lists

Assume you have two lists that are each reverse sorted:

```
[10, 9, 6, 3, 1]
[8, 6, 5, 2]
```

Write an algorithm to merge them into a single ascending list:

```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Restrictions

Don't use any of the following:

* `.reverse`
* `.sort` or `.sort_by`
* negative array indicies, `.last`, or `.pop`

## Timing

Try to complete this challenge with tests in under 20 minutes.
